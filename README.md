## 📝 About the Project

This project was inspired by the concept of Habitica — a popular productivity tool that turns everyday tasks into exciting quests and adventures. The author aimed to create their own version of this approach, combining RPG mechanics with daily task management.

This project is the author’s first personal project, serving as a kind of “field experiment” for practicing the full development cycle: from design and frontend to backend and database management. It provided an opportunity to dive deeper into technologies, refine client-server integration skills, and implement a personal vision of gamified productivity.

The project not only advanced the author technically but also allowed experimentation with game mechanics in a real environment, emphasizing the importance of motivation and personal progress for users.
